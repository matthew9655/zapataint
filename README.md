# Zapata Interview

Hi Vlad and Dave, thank you for taking the time to understand the ideas I want to present. There for two main concepts: A Quantum Circuit Generator and a vehicle tracking algorithm for my undergraduate capstone project. 

You can find a detailed `README` in each of those folders. Also you will need to create a virtual environment to run the circuit generator. The `requirements.txt` is included.
